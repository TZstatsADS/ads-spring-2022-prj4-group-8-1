+ Project summary: We mainly focus on two algorithms and compare the evaluation of them: Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment (DM and DM-sen) and Handling Conditional Discrimination (LM and LPS).
	
**Contribution statement**: 
+ Sarah Kurihara:
+ Varchasvi Vedula: Implemented Local Massaging (A6) and all helper functions for A6 algorithms and evaluation. Wrote the slides for A6.
+ Wenhui Fang: Mainly responsible for the Algorithm 4 implementation, built logistic regression model with modified loss function to restrict misclassfication rate.
+ Krista Zhang:
+ Sharon Meng: The presenter. Mainly responsible for the Algorithm 4 summary and implementation (DM and DM-sen), built neural network and logistic regression baseline model, Edited presentation report, helped organized github repo.
